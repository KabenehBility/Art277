      <h1> Re: Albert Momo university application</h1><hr/><br>
      Dear Mr. Momo,<br>
      <p>Thank you for your recent application ro join us at the Starz University's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your question one by one, in the following sections.</p>
      <h2>Starting</h2>
      <p> We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p><br>
       First Semester: 9 October 2022<br>
       Second semester: 15 January 2023<br>

      <p> Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p><br>
      You can find more information about important university dates on our website.<br/> <h3>Subjects of study</h3>
      <p>At Starz University, we have a pretty open-minded research facility-as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:<br/>
      Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)<br><br>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30<sup>0</sup>C (86<sup>0</sup>F), when the audience size exponentially increase (effect of 3x10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3x10<sup>4</sup>.)<br/>
      <p>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</p><p> So please can you provide me information oneach of these subjects, including how long you'd need to know? Thanks.</p>
      <h4>Exotic dance moves<h4>
        <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question my favorite dances are as follows, with definitions:<br><br>
        Polynesian chicken dance<br><dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a circle  chicken to encourage their sock to e fruitful".</dd><br>Icelandic brownian shuffle<br><dd>Before the icelander develop fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved hudding close together in a circle on the floor; and shuffling theirbodies around in imperceptibly tiny,very rapid movements . One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspire modern styles such as Twerking.</dd><br>Arctic robot dance<br><dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believe to have discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practice by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were moving like this because they were really cold.</dd></p>

        <p>Your sincerely,</p>
